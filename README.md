Tweaker raspberry pi 2

Raspberry Pi 2 CPU Tweaker is a script written exclusively on Raspberry Pi 2.

If overclocking the cpu recommend a cooling kit: 2 sinks for Raspberry Pi.

With this script, you can do / see these things:

CPU Temperature
CPU Voltage
The minimum processor speed
Top speed CPU
CPU current speed
Sampling rate (sampling frequency)> if the CPU is Governor "OnDemand"
The sampling rate min (minimum sampling rate)> if the CPU is Governor "OnDemand"
Until threshold (maximum threshold of the increase in the burden of processor frequency. Recommended 50%)> if the CPU is Governor "OnDemand"
Transition latency (CPU speed change is made in x nano seconds)
Changing Governor CPU (the performance of the governor, PowerSave, the user space, OnDemand, Conservative)
Overclocking
Check the script updates the main menu
